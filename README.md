# CSE541-Computer-Vision-Pose-Estimation
This is a semester-long project that I have worked on for the course CSE541 Computer Vision. The aim is to estimate the pose of an athlete given the image or video of the athlete. It includes the following steps: key point estimation, skeletonization, pose estimation, angle estimation, thresholding, and pose detection/classification.
